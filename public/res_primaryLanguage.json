      "description": "My name is Hayden Cleaver and I'm a software developer.  I was previously a military linguist for 6 years.  Since then I have been in school for a couple of years but I have decided to switch tracks and pursue opportunities in the tech industry.  I chose software development in particular because I'm familiar with detailed analysis and dealing with new languages from my time in the military.  I think that those skills have transferred pretty well into helping me adjust and learn how to code in an immersive training program. I also have pretty extensive experience with teamwork and professional correspondence and communication, and I would love to take those abilities and my training and apply what I've learned to contribute to a team as well as continue to develop my skills in this field.
